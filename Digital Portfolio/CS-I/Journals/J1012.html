    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Align the digits vertically</li>
      <li>Add the rightmost column together, and carry over the value that is represented by more than a single digit</li>
      <li>Repeat the process for the next column and so on until we don't carry</li>
      <li>The number made at the bottom is the sum of your numbers</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?
    </h2>
    <p>Because octal notation only has eight unique digits (0-7) when we add, we have to skip any numbers that include either 8 or 9.</p>
    <h2>3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h2>
    <p>In the hexadecimal system, we need to remember that after 9, the first six digits are going to be A,B,C,D,E and F. The number 10 appears after the 6 digits and is carried over because it is a value that cannot be represented by a single digit</p>
    <h2>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h2>
    <p>In the binary system, only two digits can be represented: 1 and 0. When adding, if 1 and 1 are added, then the value of the number becomes 10, which is above the capacity that can be represented by a single digit, so it is carried over and added and so on. Also, when a carry and 1 and 1 are added, then it represents 11</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to add number with different bases</p>
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter</h2>
    <p>No challenges today</p>
    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I could better understand how the number lines of different systems work</p>
    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>It has allowed me to understand how to add numbers in different bases such as the octal, hexadecimal and binary system</p>
