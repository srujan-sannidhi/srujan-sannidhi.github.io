    <u><h1> Questions </h1></u>
    <u><h2>1.1: What is Git communicating to you?</h2></u>
    <p>It shows the commit's unique tag, the author of the commit, the date, and the commit message</p>
    <u><h2>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h2></u>
    <p>The log shows the same commit message that I left when I executed git commit</p>
    <u><h2>1.3: Why do you think this is?</h2></u>
    <p>This is because we are asking git to show us what we saved and help us remember what we did by showing us the message that we left there and showing us the time and date of the change</p>
    <u><h2>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h2></u>
    <p>It shows us that these files exist, and file 1 has changes made, but file 2 gives a "this file has not been added to git message"</p>
    <u><h2>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h2></u>
    <p>They are not in the same section because file 2 has not been added to git, but file 1 already has</p>
    <u><h2>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h2></u>
    <p>It shows that file 1 has changes to be commited, and file 2 has been created.</p>
    <u><h2>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h2></u>
    <p>File 1 has been modified and needs to be committed, file 2 has been created and needs to be commited.</p>
    <u><h2>4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h2></u>
    <p>It shows that 2 files have been changes</p>
    <u><h2>4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h2></u>
    <p>The differences that are listed here are the changes from when we added lines to both files. It is shown in the color green.</p>
    <u><h2>5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h2></u>
    <p>Git doesn't actually tell me that anything has changed because we have already committed our changes</p>
    <hr>
    <u><h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2></u>
    <p>I learned how to use git in order to track the changes I make to my documents</p>
    <u><h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2></u>
    <p>No challenges today</p>
    <u><h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2></u>
    <p>I could have probably logged during the activity in order to get a more authentic log</p>
    <u><h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2></u>
    <p>I was able to learn how to use git for efficiency and for my own benefit, not much else to it</p>
