I recieved assistance from: No one

I assisted: Abhi Reddy
1.1:
One of the other services I use is Minecraft
Another of the services that I use is Google

2.1:
I think that the ability to have 2 different users makes it easier for multiple users to have 2 different instances of a service personalized to their own liking.

3.1
The ~ represents your home directory or root

4.1
The prompt now shows that we are in a folder inside of the root drectory "Merlin"

5.1
Pressing the up arrow puts your most recent entered command
5.2
Pressing the down arrow puts your least recent entered command

6.1
The text did not display because the echo command wrote the "Hello, world!" text to the out.txt file instead

7.1
The ls command shows everything in the directory, but tree shows everything in the directory, and everything in the child directories after that
7.2
Ls is only used for seeing what you have in a certain directory, but tree is used to see the hierarchy of files starting at the certain directory

8.1
Sleep defines a timeout
8.2
When entering a sleep timeout, no actions can be made except to cancel it using ctrl + c

9.1
The sleep function runs in the background when putting & after the sleep command
9.2
Makes it so that it can run while entering a command or running it to the point where it cannot affect you.
9.3
The numbers represent the order of the proccesses

10.1
The jobs commands shows what proccesses are running or done
10.2
This shows what order that the proccesses are in, what they are and if they are done or not

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned some basic commands on how to do certain functions in tabby such as making files, directories and such as well as deleting them. I was able to figure how to run jobs and make files and run processes.

What challenges did I encounter?
No challenges today.

How could this experience be improved?
Get more fluent in learning tabby commands so that I do not have to keep looking at a document.

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
It has enabled me to learn that terminals are actually way simpler than I thought and I can do simple tasks now in a linux ssh terminal.
