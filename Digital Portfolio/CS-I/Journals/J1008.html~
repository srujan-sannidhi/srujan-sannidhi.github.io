    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1: If you're outside the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"?</h2>
    <p>It prints "Outside of Merlin"</p>
    <h2>2.1: If you're inside the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"?</h2>
    <p>It prints "Merlin Root"</p>
    <h2>2.2: Based on the output of the above command, what information does the  Merlin Mission Manager  provide to you?</h2>
    <p>It shows a list of the available missions completed missions, their due dates, their assign dates, and their expiration dates</p>
    <h2>3.1: Look at the directory listing before and after you issued the "merlin prepare" command. What's changed?</h2>
    <p>New directories for each mission have been added.</p>
    <h2>3.2: What do you think the purpose of the "prepare" command is?</h2>
    <p>To prepare new directories for the student to access the missions</p>
    <h2>4.1: What changed in this directory after you issued the prepare command?</h2>
    <p>New files have been added for the actual missions such as the instructions (instructions.txt), the answer document (answers.txt), and the question document (questions.txt).</p>
    <h2>4.2: What is the purpose of the prepare command and how does its role differ depending on context?</h2>
    <p>The purpose is to make the necessary files or folders for the directory that you are currently in. The roles change depending on what directory you are in, for example: if a student is in the the challenge directory, it makes files for your answers and questions, but if you are in the mission directory, it makes directories for the challenges themselves.</p>
