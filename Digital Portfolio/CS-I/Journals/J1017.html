    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h2>
    <p>The truth table with inputs 1, 1</p>
    <h2>1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h2>
    <p>The truth tables with inputs 0, 1 and 1, 0</p>
    <h2>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h2>
    <p>The first half of the full adder has the exact same truth tables as the entire half adder</p>
    <h2>2.2: Why is this true?</h2>
    <p>Because we have no carry in involved, the inputs are basically the exact same.</p>
    <h2>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h2>
    <p>We do not have any carried inputs at the first bit, so a full adder is not necessary</p>
    <h2>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
    <p>Most likely, because we find S and carry over any extra input after we find S</p>
    <h2>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h2>
    <p>We can infer that to every value under C15 had to have at least 2 inputs true to carry it over and C15 had to have either 1 input as true or 3 inputs as true. This is also known as a ripple carry adder.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the big idea?</h2>
    <p>I learned about the different types of binary adders such as the half adder, full adder and the ripple carry adder.</p>
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>No challlenges today</p>
    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>Maybe the page could be a little more detailed about what each part of the truth table does</p>
    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>It has allowed me to better understand binary addition and carrying by introducing half adders, full adders and ripple carry adders</p>
