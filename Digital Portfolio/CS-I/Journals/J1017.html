    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h2>
    <p>The truth table with inputs 1, 1</p>
    <h2>1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h2>
    <p>The truth tables with inputs 0, 1 and 1, 0</p>
    <h2>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h2>
    <p>The first half of the full adder has the exact same truth tables as the entire half adder</p>
    <h2>2.2: Why is this true?</h2>
    <p>Because we have no carry in involved, the inputs are basically the exact same.</p>
    <h2>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h2>
    <p>We do not have any carried inputs at the first bit, so a full adder is not necessary</p>
    <h2>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
    <p>Most likely, because we find S and carry over any extra input after we find S</p>
    <h2>3.3:
