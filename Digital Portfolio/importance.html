    <h1>Why the portfolio is important to me</h1>
      <h3>This digital portfolio is important to me because it allows me to record my experiences and projects here in CS-I, II, and III</h3>

      <h3>This is going to help me and others track my progress as I move on throughout this course to make more programs and webpages.</h3>

      <h3>The journals that I create in this digital portfolio will help me remember what I learned and will help me understand anything I learned before.</h3>

      <h3>The Digital Portfolio is also documentation of my work and can help pave the way to a career of my choice one day.</h3>

      <h3>Also copyright infrigment, you know who you are.</h3>
